AIXM_WX is an AIXM Profile for use in the weather community.  This profile is based 
on AIXM 5.1, which was released on 2010-02-01.  As an AIXM profile, this schema is identical 
to AIXM 5.1 except that unneeded AIXM content has been removed.  This profile
may be used in XML schemaLocations as an alternative to the original AIXM 5.1 
schema.

The AIXM_WX profile contains those portions of AIXM that are needed to identify and locate 
aeronautical regions related to weather reporting.  This profile includes a selected set of 
properties from the following AIXM types:

  -AirportHeliport
  -Airspace
  -AirspaceVolume
  -Runway
  -RunwayDirection
  -Unit

Two files differ from the original AIXM versions: AIXM_Features.xsd and AIXM_DataTypes.xsd.
All other files are unchanged.
