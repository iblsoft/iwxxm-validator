      <documentation>Package 'Meteorological basic types' contains: - a palette of quantity value [1] classes
         specialising Measure (or subclasses thereof) for meteorological, hydrological and
         oceanographic physical properties; - a palette of «CodeList» classes for expressing
         nominal values of meteorological, hydrological and oceanographic physical properties;
         and - various other common basic types used in describing meteorological phenomena.
         As GML is currently specified, Measure (from ISO 19103 Basic types) _CANNOT_ be specialised.
         Therefore, the definition of quantity-value classes such as ThermodynamicTemperature
         and AirTemperature as specialisations of Measure is _ILLEGAL_ with respect to GML.
         For this reason 'Meteorological basic types' is published as a separate package outside
         the scope of METCE.  As a complement to "ISO 19103 Basic types", "Meteorological basic
         types" will provide a set of classes and XML types required to describe the physical
         quantities of interest to meteorologists.  [1] Quantity Value: number and reference
         together expressing magnitude of a Quantity (from the 'International vocabulary of
         metrology' [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf])
