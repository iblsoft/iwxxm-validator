		<documentation>The 'Procedure' package provides a concrete implementation of the abstract OM_Process class (from ISO 19156).

The implementation is intended to support the following requirements:
1) reference to supporting documentation (attribute "documentationRef"); e.g. online documentation describing the procedure in detail;
2) specification of parameters that remain fixed within a particular configuration of the procedure (Configuration); a soft-typed approach is used here following the pattern adopted for OM_Observation/parameter;
3) specification of the resolution [1] with which each observed physical phenomenon is measured; and
4) specification of the measuring interval [2] of the instrument or sensor for each observed physical phenomenon.

[1] Resolution: smallest change in a quantity being measured that causes a perceptible change in the corresponding indication (from the 'International vocabulary of metrology' [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf])
[2] Measuring interval: set of values of quantities of the same kind that can be measured by a given measuring instrument or measuring system with specified instrumental uncertainty, under defined conditions (from the 'International vocabulary of metrology' [http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/documents/jcgm/JCGM_200_2008.pdf])

			<documentation>Class 'OM_Process' (related to OM_Observation via the 'Procedure' Association) is used to define the process(es) involved in generating an observation. An instance of OM_Process is often an instrument or sensor (perhaps even a sensor in a given calibrated state), but it may be a human observer executing a set of instructions, a simulator or process algorithm. The 'Procedure' should provide sufficient information to interpret the result of an observation; thus if a sensor is recalibrated or its height above local ground is changed, a new instance of OM_Process should be created and associated with subsequent observations from that sensor (at least until the sensor is changed again).

Predominantly we expect the Process instance to be externally published / defined and 'static' (e.g. perhaps changing less often than once per month due to amendments to operational protocols etc.).

The class 'Process' provides a concrete implementation of OM_Process (from ISO 19156).

The implementation is intended to support the following requirements:
1) reference to supporting documentation (documentationRef); e.g. online documentation describing the procedure in detail;
2) specification of parameters that remain fixed within a particular configuration of the procedure (Configuration); a soft-typed approach is used here following the pattern adopted for OM_Observation/parameter;
3) specification of the resolution [1] with which each observed physical phenomenon is measured; and
4) specification of the measuring interval [2] of the instrument or sensor for each observed physical phenomenon.

							<documentation>The attribute 'measurand' [1] specifies the physical property that the associated 'resolution' and 'measuring interval' apply to.

The measurand may be sourced from an external controlled vocabulary, thesaurus or ontology or defined locally. 

The measurand may reference a qualified observable property if required. 

If the measurand references an observable physical property that serves as the base property for a qualified observable property, the measurement context is assumed to apply to ALL the qualified observable properties that reference this base property unless otherwise stated. For example, observable physical property 'radiance' may be qualified to measure wavelength bands 50-100nm, 100-200nm, 200-500nm etc. A measurement context associated with 'radiance' would be inferred to apply to all of these qualified radiance properties.
